ðŸ“Œ Features

    Interactive UI to input lifestyle habits:

        Monthly electricity usage (kWh)

        Weekly kilometers driven

        Flights taken per year

        Monthly waste generation

        Diet type (Vegan, Vegetarian, Omnivore)

    Machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) trained on synthetic data with >100 data points

    On-screen results showing the estimated monthly carbon footprint (kg COâ‚‚ equivalent)

    Synthetic dataset included as an Excel file for reproducibility

ðŸ“Œ Notes

    This project uses synthetic data for demonstration and is not intended for real-world carbon tracking.

    The synthetic carbon footprint formula is illustrative and does not reflect precise environmental science.
